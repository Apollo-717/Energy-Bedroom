# Energy-Bedroom
copy of bedroom awareness for energy use
## Inspiration - really wanted to do a project in unreal engine while also creating something useful so I thought it'd be interesting to find out how much energy I'm using

## What it does - Basically its just a replica of my bedroom with some text pop ups tell you about be and giving energy use stats

## How we built it - built all on unreal engine 5 started with constructing the walls the the window then all the props (bed, desk, etc..) then I created the popups.

## Challenges we ran into - The lighting in the current engine is a little bugged so I had to raise the ceiling a little to let natural light in I had to learn how to create pop ups as well

## Accomplishments that we're proud of - The model is almost 100% accurate to my real life room it took some fine attention to detail

## What we learned - I'm much more confident in my abilities in unreal engine having to improve my skills in texture creation 3d modeling and using online resources to fast track my work

## What's next for KV Challenge Bedroom Clark - Hoping to fix the lighting later on and possibly add animated things such as the ceiling fan and maybe add a video to the monitor
